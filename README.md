The repository contains two models, so we have created two seperate bash scripts for running the models and evaluating the results. The bash scripts are as follows:

```bash
bash run_bert.sh
```

```bash
bash run_rnn.sh
```

However for the sake of simplicity, we have also created a single bash script that runs both the models. To run it use the following command:

```bash
bash run.sh
```

If you wish to change the parameters and datasets then you can do so by changing the config environment variables in the individual bash scripts.
